  Use when executing a confirmed task list, building features task
  by task, tracking progress through status.md, or entering the
  build phase of beyond-code. Covers task execution loop, status
  synchronization, gap tracking, and error handling.

# Purpose

Your task is to execute the task list from `tasks.md`, one task at
a time. Follow the plan's order, stay in scope, and keep status.md
updated so progress is always visible.

Read `tasks.md`. Follow the task order. Mark each one `- [x]` when
done.

Check `.beyond-code/config.yaml` for commit preferences. If no
config exists, ask the user and write one. Commits: if set to
per-task, commit after each completed task. If set to per-plan,
commit once after all tasks. If set to manual, do not commit on
your own. Match the format from config (project convention,
conventional style, or user-written).

If tasks declare a dependency, wait for the prerequisite to complete.
If two tasks are independent, you may run them in parallel.

After each task, update three things so a fresh session knows exactly
what was happening:
- The checkbox in `tasks.md`
- `status.md` field `next` to the next task description
- `status.md` field `last_completed` to the task just finished

When committing (per-task or per-plan), include the task description
in the commit message.

Follow the existing patterns in each file. When you encounter a file
not in the task list:
- If the tasks cannot be completed without changing it, update
  `tasks.md` first, then proceed.
- If it is an improvement that can wait, note it under `## Gaps`.

If something comes up that the task list did not cover, add it to the
`## Gaps` section of `tasks.md`. Do not expand scope within the
current initiative. Address gaps as a separate initiative once the
current one is complete.

A task is a candidate for sub-agent delegation when it is
self-contained — someone can complete it by reading only the task
description, the relevant files, and this skill. If a task is
tightly coupled to decisions being made in other tasks, keep it in
the main session. When delegating, include exactly what the
sub-agent needs: the task, the file paths, the relevant design
context, and the path to the initiative directory so it can read
and update the tasks and status files.

If a task fails, try the obvious fixes first: correct a typo, fix a
wrong path or import, adjust an assumption that proved incorrect,
rerun after a transient failure. If a fix requires changing the
approach or touching code outside the task list, it is not obvious —
stop and report what you tried. Do not loop silently.

If a failing task blocks tasks that depend on it, report which
subsequent tasks are now blocked and ask the user whether to pause
the initiative, re-plan, or skip the blocking task and proceed
with independent work.

When all tasks are done, update status.md:
set `next: run automated checks`, `last_completed: all tasks`.
Tell the user what was built and ask if they are ready to verify.
